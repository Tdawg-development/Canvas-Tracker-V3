# Query Builder Analysis Report

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Project**: Canvas Tracker V3  
**Analysis**: Cross-reference between `query_builder.py` and database models

## Executive Summary

The query builder is **75% correct** and well-structured, but contains several **critical runtime issues** that would cause failures when executed against the actual database models. The architectural understanding is sound, but implementation details need alignment with the actual model structure.

## ✅ What's Working Correctly

1. **Model Imports**: All model imports are correct and reference the actual implemented models
2. **Table Name References**: All `__table__` references align with actual model tablenames  
3. **Most Field References**: The majority of field references match the implemented model fields
4. **Query Structure**: Overall query construction patterns are sound and follow SQLAlchemy best practices
5. **Method Architecture**: The QueryBuilder class design and method signatures are well-designed

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found

### 1. Join Relationship Errors

**Issue**: Several join conditions use incorrect SQLAlchemy join syntax.

**Location**: Line 233 in `build_course_enrollment_query`
```python
# INCORRECT - Using method join instead of explicit table join
AssignmentScore.join(CanvasAssignment, AssignmentScore.assignment_id == CanvasAssignment.id)
```

**Should be**: 
```python
AssignmentScore.__table__.join(
    CanvasAssignment.__table__, 
    AssignmentScore.assignment_id == CanvasAssignment.id
)
```

**Impact**: Runtime failures when executing queries with complex joins.

### 2. Active Field References on Wrong Models

**Issue**: Queries reference `active` fields on Canvas Layer 1 models that don't have them.

**Location**: Lines 638-639 in `add_active_filter` utility function
```python
# PROBLEMATIC - Canvas Layer 1 models don't have 'active' fields
for model_class in model_classes:
    if hasattr(model_class, 'active'):
        conditions.append(model_class.active == True)
```

**Reality**: Only Layer 0 lifecycle models (`ObjectStatus`, `EnrollmentStatus`) have `active` fields, not Layer 1 Canvas models (`CanvasCourse`, `CanvasStudent`, `CanvasAssignment`, `CanvasEnrollment`).

**Impact**: AttributeError when trying to filter by non-existent `active` fields.

### 3. Missing Layer 0 Integration

**Issue**: The query builder completely ignores Layer 0 lifecycle management, which is a core part of the database architecture.

**Missing Features**:
- No integration with `ObjectStatus` table for soft-delete functionality
- No filtering by object lifecycle status
- No consideration of `EnrollmentStatus` for enrollment queries

**Impact**: Queries may return "deleted" or inactive objects that shouldn't be visible.

### 4. Incorrect Join Method Usage

**Issue**: Some queries use model.join() methods instead of explicit table joins in complex scenarios.

**Location**: Line 469 in `build_recent_activity_query`
```python
# POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC
StudentMetadata.join(CanvasStudent, StudentMetadata.student_id == CanvasStudent.student_id)
```

**Impact**: May cause issues in complex query scenarios or with certain SQLAlchemy versions.

## 🔧 Specific Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Correct Table Joins

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Files Affected**: `query_builder.py` lines 233, 469, and other complex joins

```python
# BEFORE
.select_from(
    AssignmentScore.join(CanvasAssignment, AssignmentScore.assignment_id == CanvasAssignment.id)
)

# AFTER
.select_from(
    AssignmentScore.__table__.join(
        CanvasAssignment.__table__, 
        AssignmentScore.assignment_id == CanvasAssignment.id
    )
)
```

### Fix 2: Remove Active Field References from Layer 1 Models

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Files Affected**: `query_builder.py` lines 638-642

```python
# BEFORE
def add_active_filter(query: Select, model_classes: List) -> Select:
    conditions = []
    for model_class in model_classes:
        if hasattr(model_class, 'active'):
            conditions.append(model_class.active == True)

# AFTER - Only apply to Layer 0 lifecycle models
def add_active_filter(query: Select, model_classes: List) -> Select:
    from database.models.layer0_lifecycle import ObjectStatus, EnrollmentStatus
    
    conditions = []
    lifecycle_models = {ObjectStatus, EnrollmentStatus}
    
    for model_class in model_classes:
        if model_class in lifecycle_models and hasattr(model_class, 'active'):
            conditions.append(model_class.active == True)
```

### Fix 3: Add Layer 0 Integration

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**New Methods Needed**:

```python
def build_active_objects_query(self, object_type: str, include_inactive: bool = False):
    """Build query that respects Layer 0 object lifecycle status."""
    # Join with ObjectStatus to filter by active status
    
def build_active_enrollments_query(self, include_inactive: bool = False):
    """Build enrollment query respecting EnrollmentStatus lifecycle."""
    # Join with EnrollmentStatus to filter by active status
```

### Fix 4: Update Enrollment Status Filtering

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Current Issue**: Queries assume `enrollment_status = 'active'` exists on `CanvasEnrollment`
**Fix**: Integrate with `EnrollmentStatus` table from Layer 0 for proper lifecycle management

## 📊 Test Coverage Issues

### Current Testing Problems

1. **Mock-Only Tests**: Tests use mocks and don't execute actual queries against database models
2. **No Runtime Validation**: Field name and join issues wouldn't be caught by current tests
3. **Missing Integration Tests**: No tests that verify queries work with real model relationships

### Recommended Test Improvements

1. **Add Integration Tests**: Execute queries against test database with real models
2. **Add Query Execution Tests**: Verify queries can be executed without syntax errors
3. **Add Result Validation Tests**: Ensure queries return expected data structure

Example integration test:
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_student_grades_query_execution(self, test_db_session):
    """Test that student grades query executes successfully."""
    query_builder = QueryBuilder(test_db_session)
    query = query_builder.build_student_grades_query()
    
    # This should not raise any exceptions
    result = test_db_session.execute(query)
    assert result is not None
```

## 🚀 Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the HIGH priority runtime errors to prevent query failures
2. **Short-term**: Add integration tests to catch future issues
3. **Medium-term**: Integrate Layer 0 lifecycle management for complete functionality
4. **Long-term**: Add performance monitoring and optimization

## 📋 Files Requiring Updates

1. **`database/operations/utilities/query_builder.py`**
   - Fix join syntax (lines 233, 469)
   - Remove active field references (lines 638-642)
   - Add Layer 0 integration methods

2. **`database/tests/test_query_builder.py`**
   - Add integration tests
   - Add query execution validation tests

## Conclusion

The query builder demonstrates solid understanding of the database architecture and SQLAlchemy patterns, but needs mechanical fixes to align with actual model implementations. Once these issues are resolved, it will be a robust and comprehensive query construction system for the Canvas Tracker application.

The fixes are primarily mechanical rather than architectural, indicating that the overall design is sound and just needs implementation details corrected.
