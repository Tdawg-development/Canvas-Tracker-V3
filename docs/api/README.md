# Canvas API Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the Canvas LMS integration layer and API interfaces.

## üìÅ Files in this Category

### Canvas Interface System
- **[canvas-interface-guide.md](./canvas-interface-guide.md)** - Main Canvas API integration documentation
  - Canvas staging system (80% of Canvas interfacing)
  - Core Canvas interface components  
  - Directory structure and usage examples
  - Performance optimization details and benchmarks

### Data Structures  
- **[canvas-data-reference.md](./canvas-data-reference.md)** - Complete Canvas data object specifications
  - CanvasCourseStaging structure and properties
  - CanvasStudentStaging with enrollment and grade data
  - CanvasModuleStaging and CanvasAssignmentStaging definitions
  - Data loading processes and relationships

## üéØ Purpose

These documents provide complete specifications for:

- **Canvas API Integration** - How the system interfaces with Canvas LMS
- **Data Structures** - Object models that mirror Canvas API responses
- **Performance Optimization** - API call reduction strategies and efficiency metrics
- **Usage Patterns** - How to use the Canvas interface system effectively

## üìä Key Features Documented

### Staging System (Primary Interface)
- **3-4 API calls per course** (typically, range: 2-6 based on complexity)
- **96%+ API call reduction** vs naive approaches
- **Sub-2 second processing** for typical courses
- **Smart optimizations** for assignment analytics

### Performance Context by Course Size
| Course Type | Students | API Calls | Typical Time |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Small | 1-25 | 2-3 calls | <1 second |
| Medium | 25-100 | 3-4 calls | 1-2 seconds |
| Large | 100-500 | 4-5 calls | 2-4 seconds |
| Enterprise | 500+ | 5-6 calls | 4-8 seconds |

## üìñ Reading Order

1. **Start with canvas-interface-guide.md** for system overview and usage
2. **Review canvas-data-reference.md** for detailed data structure specifications
