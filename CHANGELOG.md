## [0.2.1] - 2024-10-13

### Added - Layer 0 Object Lifecycle & Canvas Timezone Handling
- **Layer 0 Object Lifecycle Models**: Complete soft-delete and lifecycle management system
  - `ObjectStatus`: Individual Canvas object lifecycle tracking (courses, students, assignments)
  - `EnrollmentStatus`: Student-course enrollment relationship lifecycle tracking
  - Soft-delete functionality with user approval workflows for data preservation
  - Dependency tracking for user metadata and historical data
  - Object reactivation support when Canvas objects return after removal
  - Comprehensive query methods for pending deletions and lifecycle state management
- **Canvas Timezone Handler**: Production-ready timezone handling for Canvas API integration
  - Native support for Canvas datetime format (`2025-07-28T16:31:18Z`)
  - Timezone-aware datetime conversion, storage, and retrieval
  - Database compatibility layer handling SQLite timezone stripping
  - Cross-timezone comparison utilities for reliable datetime operations
  - Helper functions for Canvas datetime parsing and API format conversion

### Fixed - Test Infrastructure & Timezone Issues
- **Transaction Management**: Resolved SQLAlchemy session teardown issues
  - Fixed `ResourceClosedError` exceptions during test cleanup
  - Improved test fixture handling for both committed and uncommitted transactions
  - Eliminated test noise and improved development experience
- **Timezone Compatibility**: Fixed timezone-related test failures
  - Proper timezone-aware datetime comparison in database tests
  - Consistent handling of naive vs timezone-aware datetimes across models
  - SQLite timezone stripping compatibility for cross-platform development

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced model initialization ensuring boolean fields never have `None` values
- Added 28 comprehensive Layer 0 lifecycle model tests covering all state transitions
- Added 22 timezone handler tests covering Canvas datetime scenarios
- Improved database test isolation and state management reliability
- Extended utility module structure for Canvas-specific operations

### Quality Assurance
- **Complete Test Coverage**: All 143 database tests now pass without errors or warnings
- **Zero Transaction Issues**: Eliminated all SQLAlchemy transaction teardown problems
- **Timezone Reliability**: Robust datetime handling ready for production Canvas API integration

## [0.2.0] - 2024-10-13

### Added - Database Layer 1 (Canvas Data Models)
- **Layer 1 Canvas Data Models**: Complete implementation of Canvas data models
  - `CanvasCourse`: Course information with Canvas course IDs as primary keys
  - `CanvasStudent`: Student enrollment and grade data with Canvas student IDs as primary keys  
  - `CanvasAssignment`: Assignment/quiz information with Canvas assignment IDs as primary keys
  - `CanvasEnrollment`: Student-course relationship model with composite primary keys
- **Enhanced Base Model Architecture**:
  - `CanvasEntityModel`: Base class for Canvas entities using Canvas IDs as primary keys
  - `CanvasRelationshipModel`: Base class for relationship models without name fields
  - Both include automatic sync tracking and timestamp management
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: 
  - Layer 1 model tests in `database/tests/test_layer1_models.py`
  - Tests cover model creation, relationships, constraints, and Canvas-specific business logic
  - All tests passing with proper database schema validation
- **Database Development Tools**:
  - `scripts/create_dev_db.py`: Development database creation script with sample data structure
  - Persistent SQLite database for manual inspection with DB Browser for SQLite

### Technical Details
- **Canvas Data Mapping**: Models precisely map from Canvas API data structures (CanvasCourseStaging, CanvasStudentStaging, etc.)
- **Primary Key Strategy**: Uses Canvas IDs as primary keys instead of auto-incrementing IDs
- **Relationship Management**: Proper SQLAlchemy relationships with overlap handling for many-to-many relationships
- **Sync Tracking**: Built-in sync tracking capabilities for all Canvas models
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity between courses, students, assignments, and enrollments

### Fixed
- **SQLAlchemy Primary Key Conflicts**: Resolved composite primary key issues with SQLite by creating dedicated base classes
- **Relationship Overlap Warnings**: Added proper `overlaps` parameters to SQLAlchemy relationships
- **Database Schema Generation**: All Layer 1 tables generate correctly without conflicts
