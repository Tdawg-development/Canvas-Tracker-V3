# Canvas Interface Testing with Pytest

This directory contains **unit tests for the canvas-interface business logic** using your existing pytest infrastructure extended for TypeScript integration.

## 🎯 Why This Approach?

You already have an **excellent pytest setup** in the database layer. Instead of switching to Jest, we've extended your pytest infrastructure to test TypeScript canvas business logic while maintaining consistency across your project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run All Canvas Interface Tests

```powershell
# From canvas-interface/tests directory
cd C:\Users\tyler\Documents\Canvas-Tracker-V3\canvas-interface\tests
pytest
```

### 2. Run Specific Test Categories

```powershell
# Canvas unit tests only
pytest -m canvas_unit

# Canvas integration tests (with database)
pytest -m "canvas_integration and database"

# Canvas data transformation tests
pytest -m canvas_data_transformation

# Fast tests only (exclude slow performance tests)
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### 3. Run Specific Test Files

```powershell
# Test canvas staging data models
pytest test_canvas_staging_data_models.py

# Test canvas data constructor
pytest test_canvas_data_constructor.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest test_canvas_staging_data_models.py -v
```

### 4. Debug Failed Tests

```powershell
# Stop on first failure
pytest -x

# Show full error traces
pytest --tb=long

# Show what's being executed
pytest -s -v
```

## 📁 Test Structure

```

├── conftest.py                          # Test configuration & fixtures
├── pytest.ini                          # Pytest configuration

└── README.md                           # This file
```

## 🧪 Test Categories

### Canvas Unit Tests (`@pytest.mark.canvas_unit`)
- Test individual business logic methods in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 30 seconds total)
- Example: Testing `student.getMissingAssignments()` logic

### Canvas Integration Tests (`@pytest.mark.canvas_integration`)
- Test complete workflows between components
- May use database fixtures from database layer
- Test canvas-interface → database integration
- Example: Testing complete course data construction workflow

### Canvas Data Transformation Tests (`@pytest.mark.canvas_data_transformation`)
- Test Canvas API data → staging data model transformation
- Validate data integrity during processing
- Example: Testing raw Canvas response parsing

## 🔧 How It Works

### Hybrid Python/TypeScript Testing
The testing approach uses **Python as the test runner** but **executes TypeScript business logic** via subprocess:

1. **pytest fixtures** provide test data and mocked Canvas API responses
2. **CanvasBusinessLogicTester** creates temporary TypeScript files and executes them with `npx tsx`
3. **Results are returned as JSON** and validated using standard pytest assertions
4. **Database integration** uses your existing database test fixtures

### Example Test Flow
```python
def test_missing_assignments_detection(self, canvas_business_logic_tester):
    # Create test data using pytest fixtures
    student_data = create_mock_canvas_student_data(current_score=75, final_score=85)
    
    # Execute TypeScript business logic
    result = canvas_business_logic_tester.test_canvas_data_model_method(
        class_name="CanvasStudentStaging",
        method_name="hasMissingAssignments", 
        test_data=student_data
    )
    
    # Use standard pytest assertions
    has_missing = assert_canvas_business_logic_result(result)
    assert has_missing is True, "Student with score gap should have missing assignments"
```
